## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes retail sales data to uncover trends, perform statistical tests, and build a predictive model. Key objectives include:
- Data cleaning and exploratory analysis.
- Sales trend identification (category, gender, monthly trends).
- Hypothesis testing and correlation analysis.
- Predictive modeling using Linear Regression (R² = 0.85).

## 📂 Dataset
**Source:** [Retail Sales Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohammadtalib786/retail-sales-dataset/data)  
Includes variables like product categories, customer demographics, sales quantity, and total amount.

## 🔍 Key Analyses & Results
1. **Sales Trends**  
   - Top-selling category: Electronics (35% of total sales).  
   - Peak sales in December (holiday season).  
   - Male customers contributed 60% of sales.  

2. **Data Visualization**  
   - Histograms, KDE plots, and correlation heatmaps (e.g., Quantity vs. Total Amount: r = 0.82).  

3. **Statistical Analysis**  
   - Significant gender-based sales difference (p-value = 0.003).  
   - High correlation between Price and Total Amount (0.89).  

4. **Machine Learning Model**  
   - Linear Regression achieved MAE = 173.12 and R² = 0.8569.  

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- **Python Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy, Scikit-learn.  
- **Methods:** T-tests, correlation analysis, feature engineering, and predictive modeling.
